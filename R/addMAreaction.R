#' Adding molecular reactions.
#'
#' Molecular reactions can be described by differential equation that define the rate of change in molecular concentrations. addMAreaction function
#' transforms reactions into ODEs using the law of mass action. Given a reaction: k1A + k2B -(r)-> k3*AB, where A and B represent reactants and AB
#' represents a product (in general, we can call A, B, and AB species), r represents the reaction rate, and k1, k2, and k3 represent stoichometric
#' coefficients, one can use the law of mass action to determine the change in the amount of each species as: dA/dt = dB/dt = - dAB/dt = -rA^(k1)B^(k2).
#' Or in general, given a reaction sum(i=1:m)[k{i}S{i}] -(r)-> sum(j=1:n)[l{j}S{j}], changes in the amount of each species can be represented as
#' dS/dt = r(l{i}-k{i})prod(i=1:m)S^(k{i}).
#' addMAreaction function adds a mass action reaction into an existing model. sysBio allows users to write reactions in two formats: 1. as forward
#' (non-reversible) reactions, e.g., A -> B, with rate r, 2. as reversible reactions, e.g., A = B, with forward rate r1 and reverse rate r2.
#' sysBio transforms and  interprets the reversible reactions as two forward reactions, e.g., A -> B, with rate r1, and B -> A, with rate r2.
#'
#' @param x  model to which the reaction is added (required)
#' @param react reaction to be added (required). sysBio uses the "->" symbol
#'     for forward reaction and the "=" symbol for the reversible reaction;
#'     values that represent stoichometric coefficients should be explicitly
#'     included in the reaction definition (e.g., 2A + B -> 1.5AB); sysBio
#'     uses a term null to describe a null species (source or sink).
#' @param r1 reaction rate (forward); if the name is not specified, sysBio
#'     will assign a generic name to the reaction rate, in the format
#'     r_{reaction_rate_number}
#' @param r2 reaction rate (reversible); if the name is not specified,
#'     sysBio will assign a generic name to the reaction rate, in the format
#'     r_{reaction_rate_number}
#' @param name name of the reaction; if the name is not specified, sysBio
#'     will assign a generic name to the reaction, in the format
#'     Reaction_{reaction_number}
#' @param overwrite a flag that allows changes to the existing reaction
#'     (default value FALSE)
#'
#' @return This function adds information about the reaction into the model (given as a first argument of the function).
#'     Reaction information is stored in the list format and contain the following elements:
#'     \itemize{
#'     \item{reaction$rName - name of the reaction}
#'     \item{reaction$reaction - reaction}
#'     \item{reaction$r1 - forward rate of the reaction}
#'     \item{reaction$r2 - reverse rate of the reaction (if available, NULL otherwise)}
#'     \item{reaction$type - asigned type "Mass Action"}
#'     }
